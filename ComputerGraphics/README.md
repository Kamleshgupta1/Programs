# Bouncing Ball
Bouncing ball is a simple animation of a ball bouncing on a floor when left to fall from a certain height.

Note:

  > *This program was writen in Turbo C Compiler 3.0 and probably won't run on any other compilers such as GCC. To see the exact output, it's recommended to run this program in Turbo C Compiler*

Some changes that can be done:
1. Making compatible with modern compilers like GCC.
2. Using OpenGL library for graphics.
3. Adding some physics to the code for ball motion.
